# Crazy Snooker

Using code from my 2D particle collision simulator to make a snooker game. The user will be able to draw boundaries to create courses.

## Overview

This is being made for a project on the Founders and Coders software development bootcamp. The assignment is to make something which allows the user to draw coloured lines on a canvas when the user clicks and drags (or swipes if you want to support mobile). Stretch goals include custom drawing settings and being able to download drawings as images. 

In my project the lines will be boundaries for the balls to bounce off.



## Credits

I used a number of resources to get the collision code working. [Peter Collingridge](https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/pygame-physics-simulation/)
has a great tutorial on this, as does [Spicy Yoghurt](https://spicyyoghurt.com/tutorials/html5-javascript-game-development/collision-detection-physics).
